# This is just a fun project to spend some free time. I haven't tested it yet. 
- The code included is a very simple code to control temperature of the heater of x1c hotend for cleaning the hotend which I haven't run yet. I don't have x1c to test with.
- I assume, the NTC of hotend is 100k ohm, please check if the correct connectors for heater/thermistor are used.
- Run this with 12V-2A DC instead of 24V. Arduino nano cannot run from 24v power adaptor. It will get hot slower but it is safer as well.
